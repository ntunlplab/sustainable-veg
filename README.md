# Sustainable-VEG: A Benchmark for Visual Evidence Grounding in ESG Reports

Sustainability and ESG reports increasingly support high-stakes decisions, yet verifying standardized disclosure indicators is difficult. Evidence is often embedded in tables, multi-column layouts, and structured visual regions, where text-linearization via OCR loses critical layout cues.

Sustainable-VEG is a benchmark for fine-grained visual evidence grounding in sustainability reports.

🔍 What It Provides
	•	📄 Page-level disclosure labels
	•	📦 Region-level bounding boxes localizing minimal supporting evidence
	•	📊 Visually complex, real-world ESG reports
	•	🌏 Emphasis on multilingual and non-Latin documents

The task requires systems to localize evidence regions, not just retrieve semantically similar text.
